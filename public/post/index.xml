&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been in touch with my PhD advisor in order to [re]write some papers that I put on indefinite hiatus since I presented my thesis. I don’t like the sensation of having unfinished work, so I decided to recover my old code and drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my master’s in Astrophysics (2012-2014) I used mainly Python to write the code for the analysis of photos from an AllSky camera. It was really nice to discover how powerful Python was and to follow the development of libraries like Pandas and PyRaf (a wrapper around IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) the very old and omnipresent software for astronomy). Astronomers are, in general, very good programmers and involved in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I changed my research topic to statistical physics I entered a whole new world: FORTRAN code, computational clusters and legacy software. It was the norm at the time: in order to do your research you had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to understand your advisor’s old code in an very deprecated version of the programming language he used;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to build your own code but in a way that your advisor and colleagues could understand, e.g., don’t using all that novel software that wasn’t proven to be really useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first year of my Phd I was strugging to get a working version of some FORTRAN 77 code. I had to understand how to simulate neuronal spikes using map equations. It involved the study of different concepts in dynamical systems like bifurcation, chaos and Lyapunov exponents. Soon I realized I didn’t want to write a thesis on these subjects using FORTRAN 77. I wanted to use new tools and methods. My team was starting to use MATLAB for some computations and soon I joined them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MATLAB is really powerful. You can do a great job when using matrices and numerical calculations. If your code is slow you can easily transform code chunks and functions into C code. Plotting is easy and the result is pleasant. However, it is not practical, specially for poor students and research teams. MATLAB’s license is very expensive and the language is not open source. Many people turn to Octave, MATLAB’s free cousin. I went back to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I faced other problems: I was the only one using Python. If I wanted to reproduce some of my colleagues’ code, I had to rewrite them. And how to convince your advisor that you could actually DO science with a programming language different from the ones they are used to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a very common issue in academia: people stick to what they know and that is proven to work. There is not much incentive to try new things. There is no need to really optimize your code. You can always* use your department’s computational cluster and leave your code running there for days or even weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working in data science for two year now. It is unimaginable to wait for more than a couple of hours to see your code deliver some results. If you do not use updated packages or frameworks you will be losing time, money and, maybe, some clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary for the folks in universities to start to be more open to the idea of new technologies. Many programming languages offer powerful libraries and computational tools. Julia is one language to keep an eye on. You don’t even need to abandon all that old code. There are wonderful libraries that provide a bridge between different languages, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/&#34;&gt;F2PY&lt;/a&gt; that allows one to run FORTRAN scripts using a Python interface, or Cython, that aims to do the same, this time with C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of different computational resources available as well. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud offer virtual machines and databases that are really easy to use and configure. There are different paying options and student and academic discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I need to make an statement in favor of open source software. If you are a scientist, it is often not recommended to depend on paid resources to do your research. Your grant can be reduced or suspended, the price could go up etc. So look for open initiatives and why not start contributing to them? Sharing knowledge, work and tools might improve your contact network and maybe allow your research to be harder, better, faster, stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;When that cluster is on and running, which is not always the case, of course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alan Turing</title>

&lt;p&gt;Today, June 28, is internationally known as Pride Day. This date was chosen as a reference to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots&#34;&gt;Stonewall Inn riots&lt;/a&gt;, an episode remembered as a milestone in gay activism. Since that day, much progress has been done towards acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people in many places around the world. In this post I want to highlight some contributions made by these people that allowed to world to become what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my academic and professional life, few names were more cited than that of Alan Turing, the British mathematician known as “the father of modern computing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in June 23, 1912, Turing developed some thoughts on the similarities between a brain and a computer, establishing the idea of the brain as a “computing machine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that is becoming mainstream in the era of Artificial Intelligente (AI) is that of a “thinking machine”. In his 1950 paper, &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238&#34;&gt;“Computing machinery and intelligence”&lt;/a&gt;, Turing proposes that if a computer can provide answers in a way indistinguishable from how a human would perform in natural language conversation, than one could argue the this computes shows a kind of intelligent behavior. In his paper he uses the Imitation Game as starting point to his arguments. Interestingly, the movie &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/&#34;&gt;“The Imitation game”&lt;/a&gt; (2014), an historical drama based on Turing’s life, barely mentions this idea, which is much better exploited in the movie &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/&#34;&gt;“Ex-Machina”&lt;/a&gt; released the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides his work on computational science, Turing is also credited for having decoded Enigma’s criptography. Enigma was a a machine used by the Nazis during the Second World War do send coded messages. Once the code was broken, the Allies could anticipate Axis’ moves and act accordingly. This episode is considered one of the war’s turning points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all his contributions were not enough to save his life. Turing was homosexual, and on 1952 he was prosecuted for “gross indecency”. He had two options: 1. prison; 2. chemical castration. He chose the latter. He was found dead on 1954, victim cyanide poisoning. However, there are some divergences whether it was suicide or accidental poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took almot 60 years to his condenation to be revisited. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25495315&#34;&gt;a posthumous pardon&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that his face will be printed on the £50 note as a recognition for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/15/alan-turing-father-of-modern-computing-50-pound-note&#34;&gt;his lifetime works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing’s life and influence in the past 50 years can be taken as an example of the presence and importance of LGBTQIA+ people in the world. Science and culture would not be so advanced or diverse or powerful if not by their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although much as been done in the past years to ensure basic human rights, there is still so much to fight for. Let’s take this day as a celebration of our conquests and a reminder of the lives, sufferings and contributions of the ones that came before. May the Alan Turing’s of today and the future be able to live as they want, be who they are, and contribute to humanity’s growth, no matter their desires and aptitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brazilian LGBT complaints in the past decade</title>

&lt;p&gt;I finally decided to start writing on this website. It was something I wanted for a long time, but always delayed for multiple reasons. The start of the Coronavirus pandemic didn’t help at all… :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to write every week about different subjects. Most of the posts will probably be some tutorials on Python, R, data science and software development as those are the things that keep me busy during the week. However, I might also write about human rights, education and research topics on neuroscience and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this first post I will present a small app I have been developing in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of this year I looked for data and information involving crimes against LGBT people in Brazil. It is said that we have one of the highest crime rates in the world&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#References&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I wanted to see the raw data and maybe try to have some insights when studying time series and correlated events on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to contact some people from &lt;a href=&#34;https://grupogaydabahia.com.br/&#34;&gt;Grupo Gay da Bahia&lt;/a&gt; but I have never received an answer. I talked to some friends and learned that crimes against LGBT people are rarely registered in official documents in a regular manner. I ended up rummaging the federal government website, notably the “Ministry of Family and Human Rights” but found only their promises of providing updated and open access data on human rights in Brazil. In a page that is no longer accessible, it is said that strategies to be adopted for the opening, support, monitoring and promotion of their database would be produced with deadline for August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I contacted them on February asking for an update on this issue (the deadline was past for about six months), but after two months of waiting they only said that “all necessary information, schedules and databases to be used will soon be published”. In other words: “we have been working for almost a year and still don’t have anything planned”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, during my time clicking around the Ministry’s website I found that at least SOME information is public. The Brazilian government provides a help line (called &lt;strong&gt;“Disque Denúncia”&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;“Disque Direitos Humanos”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#References&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) so people can call and denounce domestic abuse, child and elderly maltreatment etc. Among the several profiles available, one can see calls coming from LGBT people. There is data from 2011 to 2019 (only partially, as this year’s data covers only until June).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded all data concerning LGBT people through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.br/mdh/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/ouvidoria/balanco-disque-100&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. The data tables are actually very complete, but all data is just the case counts in multiple categories (sex, age, location…). Because of this I was not able to get any insights from it, but I decided to organize it to make it easier for people to look at some trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do that, I developed a very simple &lt;strong&gt;Shiny&lt;/strong&gt; application in &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see the result &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerbortolotto.shinyapps.io/denuncialgbt/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (Portuguese only). Data is separated in tabs representing different complainant profiles. You can see how the cases increases or decreases for different Brazilian states in the past eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gerbortolotto.shinyapps.io/denuncialgbt/&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://gbortolotto.github.io/img/denuncia_ex.png&#34; alt=&#34;no css&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I could update this application as new data was released. However, the Brazilian government changed how this information would be released. Their last report sum up the cases in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.br/mdh/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/ouvidoria/Relatorio_Disque_100_2019_.pdf&#34;&gt;a pdf file&lt;/a&gt; and one can’t access the raw data as I did. If the government decides to releases open data, I will develop a new app and try to provide some kind of easily accessible platform. Until then and without new data I think this app will be just a snapshot of complaints made by LGBT people by middle 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the data used in the development os this app can be found on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gbortolotto/lgbtapp&#34;&gt;Github page&lt;/a&gt; (the code needs some cleaning…) and only exists thanks to projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shinyapps.io/&#34;&gt;Shinyapps.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I intend to write in English in this website, but I will probably translate the posts about this app as it concerns primarily the Brazilian LGBT population.&lt;/p&gt;
