abstract: Neurons and cardiac cells are known to be susceptible to electromagnetic radiation. Although many mathematical models exist to represent these cells, only recently there was an effort to include the electromagnetic induction on the membrane potential equations. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the induction on the logistic KTz, a computationally efficient map-based action potential model, and compare them to the more widely used Hindmarsh–Rose model. We study the effects of a self-induced current on a single cell and the synchronization of cells coupled through an induction current caused by the magnetic flux of the neighbor. We also study the emergence of aperiodic behaviors and the presence of chaos, as an effect of the inclusion of the induction. Besides, we use a simple network of KTz elements to show that the electromagnetic induction is relevant for the study of pattern formation. Additionally, we report for the first time the presence of cardiac spikes in the Hindmarsh–Rose model. Our results demonstrate the importance of implementing the induction current on different models and we provide a computationally efficient alternative to better understand how the induction acts on neuronal and cardiac cells.
